# hello-world
Getting started project on github

I live in the Manchester, UK. I teach for a living and am interested in a wide range of things, including the outdoors, reading, playing guitar and piano, video games, drawing, physics, maths and technology.

I have been coding as a hobby for a number of years. I've experimented with HTML, JavaScript, Swift, Objective-C and Java.
